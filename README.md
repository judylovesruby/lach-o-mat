# Lach-o-Mat

This site is a small experiment. 
I had the idea of a page which shows a random joke on page load for quite a while now. After building static sites with middleman and jekyll, I also wanted to see how "minimal" you could go and to find out where the pain of that lies ;)

## Local Development

You need a local file server. Which one you choose should make no difference. [Here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) is a awesome list.

I'm using python's `http.server`:

Run `cd docs && python3 -m http.server 3000` to start it. Then use your browser to navigate to `localhost:3000`
