# Witze

This site is a small experiment. 
I had the idea of a page which shows a random joke on page load for quite a while now. After building static sites with middleman and jekyll, I also wanted to see how "minimal" you could go.

## Local Development

Run `cd site && python3 -m http.server 8000` to start a local server. Then use your browser to navigate to `localhost:8000`
